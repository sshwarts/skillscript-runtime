# Skillscript Language Reference — syntax, ops, semantics

Canonical language reference for skillscript. Audience: skill authors (human + agent). Specifies what is valid syntax, what behavior to expect at compile + runtime, and what is currently pending implementation.

Implementation state is cross-referenced to commit hashes; pending items mark v2/v3 work.

Companion docs under the Skillscript project anchor:
- `skillscript-prd` — product positioning, value prop, roadmap
- `skillscript-erd` — engineering requirements, system architecture, runtime mechanics

## Overview & language model — declarative dispatch DAG, goal-directed execution

Skillscript is a constrained domain-specific language for authoring agent workflows. A skillscript is a declarative recipe: a small program with a dependency DAG of named targets, each composed of typed operations. Skillscripts are written once and executed many times.

## Language model

**Declarative DAG, not imperative script.** A skillscript declares targets and their dependencies (`needs:` keyword); the interpreter topologically sorts and executes them in dependency order. Write blocks in any order — the runtime walks the graph.

**Goal-directed, not entry-point-directed.** The `default:` declaration names the *goal target* — the terminal node whose result is the skill's output. The runtime walks dependencies backward from the goal through the topo-sort. A skill with a single target obscures this (goal == entry trivially); skills with multi-target DAGs make the shape visible.

**Authored by agents, executed by interpreter or compiled to agent prompts.** Two execution paths from the same source:
- **Runtime-mediated** — the interpreter walks ops and dispatches them directly through configured connectors (MemoryStore, LocalModel, MCP). Used for autonomous fires (cron, session-triggered, event-triggered). Safety boundary is the connector config.
- **Agent-mediated** — the compiler renders the skill as a prompt; an agent reads the prompt and executes ops through its own tools (Bash, MCP clients, etc.). Used when an agent invokes a skill mid-conversation. Safety boundary is the agent's harness tool permissions.

The language is identical in both paths. The execution model is a deployment-time + invocation-time decision.

## Three kinds of skill

Skills deliver value in one of three shapes, determined by the relationship between the skill and the *frontier agent* that may consume its output:

- **Headless** — the skill runs end-to-end via the runtime and emits its result to a destination (Slack, file, database, none). No frontier agent is involved in the execution. Example: a cron-fired log-analysis skill that posts a summary to a destination channel.
- **Augmenting** — the skill runs (typically runtime-mediated) and delivers an artifact to a frontier agent for consumption. The agent uses the delivered data, context, or transformed input in its own reasoning. Example: a `session: start` skill that emits `prompt-context:` content prepended to the next inference.
- **Template** — the skill compiles to a prompt that a frontier agent executes itself. The runtime doesn't dispatch ops; it renders a prompt the agent follows. Example: a reusable "how to triage a bug report" recipe an agent invokes mid-conversation via the compile-to-prompt API.

The kind is determined by `# Output:` and the invocation path, not by a separate declaration. A skill author chooses by deciding *who consumes the output*: a destination, a frontier agent's reasoning, or a frontier agent's execution loop. The Headless/Augmenting/Template distinction is orthogonal to the runtime-mediated/agent-mediated execution-mode distinction described above.

**The kinds compose.** In practice, skills route between kinds based on runtime decisions. A Headless skill running on a cron fires, evaluates a condition, and based on the result either stays Headless (writes a log entry, posts to a channel, exits quietly) or invokes a downstream skill that delivers Augmenting context to wake a frontier agent — or writes out a Template the agent picks up later. The taxonomy describes the delivery shape of a *single execution path*; a chain of skills traverses multiple kinds. Most non-trivial skill systems mix all three.

## Anatomy of a skill

```
# Skill: get-weather
# Description: Fetch current weather for the user's location
# Vars: LOCATION=ip-based, UNITS=imperial
# Requires: user-var:location -> LOCATION (fallback: ip-based)
# Triggers:
# Output: text

fetch:
    @ curl -s "wttr.in/$(LOCATION|url)?format=j1" -> RAW
    ~ prompt="Format weather summary: $(RAW)" -> SUMMARY
    ! $(SUMMARY)

default: fetch
```

Three layers of declaration:
1. **Header metadata** (`# Key: value` lines) — name, description, declared variables, dependencies, triggers, output routing, error fallbacks
2. **Targets** — named blocks of typed ops, optionally with `needs:` dependencies
3. **`default:`** — names the goal target the runtime walks toward

### Declaring target dependencies

Three equivalent syntactic forms — pick whichever reads best for the skill. All parse to the same dep list:

```
# Terse / Make-style — single line, deps separated by whitespace
emit: evaluate
    ! result

# Header form with explicit `needs:` keyword — accepts comma-separated deps
emit: needs: evaluate, validate
    ! result

# Body-line form — `needs:` at the target body's main scope
emit:
    needs: evaluate
    needs: validate
    ! result
```

The body-line form is recognized only at the target's main scope, not inside nested `if`/`elif`/`else`/`foreach` blocks. The runtime topologically sorts targets via these declared deps and walks the graph from the `default:` entry — so a target with no incoming dep edge from the entry will be flagged as unreachable at compile time.

## Lexical conventions

The grammar is small but strict. A few rules that determine how the parser reads source:

### Indentation: spaces only

Block structure (`foreach`, `if`/`elif`/`else:`, target bodies, error-handler `else:` blocks) is determined by indentation. **Use spaces. Tabs are a parse error.** Mixed tabs+spaces in a single file is a parse error. No convention to debate, no editor config to align — the language enforces one rule.

The conventional indent is 4 spaces, but any consistent depth within a block is acceptable. The parser tracks each block's indent level on entry and rejects mid-block changes.

### Reserved keywords

The following identifiers are reserved and cannot be used as variable names, target names, or skill names:

**Currently in use:** `default`, `needs`, `if`, `elif`, `else`, `foreach`, `in`, `not`, `unsafe`

**Future-reserved** (no current semantics, reserved to keep v2 grammar additions non-breaking): `while`, `for`, `match`, `try`, `catch`, `return`

Reserved-name use produces a parse error with a specific diagnostic:

```
error: 'default' is a reserved keyword and cannot be used as a variable name
  # Vars: default=foo
          ^^^^^^^
  rename the variable (e.g., default_value)
```

**Case sensitivity.** Reserved words are exact-match case-sensitive. `default` is reserved; `Default` is allowed. `If` is allowed as an identifier; `if` is the control-flow keyword.

### Enumerated value normalization

For frontmatter keys with a closed set of accepted values (`# Status:`, `# Output:` kinds, trigger sources, etc.), values are accepted case-insensitively on input and stored as their canonical form. `# Status: draft`, `# Status: Draft`, and `# Status: DRAFT` all parse to the same canonical `Draft`. The principle is consistent across every enumerated frontmatter field.

This applies to value-space normalization only — keys remain case-sensitive (`# Status:` is the header; `# status:` is a parse error).

## Storage and identity

Skillscripts are stored via a configured `SkillStore` backend. The backend persists each skill as a uniquely-named record; writing a skill with an existing name updates in place. Skill records are infrastructure, not knowledge atoms — backends with garbage-collection or expiry semantics should treat skills as long-lived first-class records, not as candidates for cleanup.

The language is storage-agnostic; the interpreter accepts a skillscript body as text regardless of source. Common SkillStore implementations:

- **Memory-backed** — skill bodies live in a knowledge-substrate (e.g., a memory-governance system) as records with a distinguished payload type. Versioning and audit trail come from the substrate.
- **File-backed** — skill bodies live on disk (e.g., for version-control workflows or distribution). Versioning and audit trail come from the filesystem and/or VCS.
- **Hybrid** — skills authored in one backend and synced to another for distribution.

The Connectors section documents the `SkillStore` interface and how to wire a custom backend.

### File-backed convention

Three-file pattern per skill on disk, mirroring the standard source/compiled split (`.ts`→`.js`, `.scss`→`.css`):

- `<skill-name>.skill.md` — **source.** Authored by humans or agents. Dual-extension: `.md` outer makes any markdown-aware tool (editor, browser, vault) render headers + code blocks natively; `.skill` inner is the language-tooling discriminator. Committed to version control.
- `<skill-name>.skill` — **compiled artifact.** The prompt text emitted by the compile API (or `skillfile compile` on disk). Agent-consumable. Typically gitignored (derived from source).
- `<skill-name>.skill.provenance.json` — **provenance sidecar.** Records source content_hash, compiled version, timestamps, data-skill staleness markers. Emitted alongside the compiled artifact. Typically gitignored.

Default `.gitignore` for a file-backed skills repo: `*.skill` and `*.skill.provenance.json`. Sources stay committed; derived artifacts don't.

## Authoring discipline

Two principles for skill authors, learned by accumulated failure across many agent-authored skills.

### Don't encode deterministic implementation details

Skills are orchestration; deterministic operations are tools. When tempted to hardcode a CLI version string, a REST endpoint payload structure, or an authentication handshake, the discipline says: *the work belongs in an MCP tool, not in the skill body*. Reasons:

- **Drift.** CLI versions change. Endpoints change. The skill that hardcodes them breaks on next update; the MCP tool that abstracts them survives.
- **Substrate-portability.** A skill that knows "the API returns `{ user: {...} }`" is bound to one API shape. A skill that calls `$ user.fetch -> USER` and accesses `$(USER.id)` works against any connector that conforms to the user-shape contract.
- **Authority.** Auth handshakes inside skill bodies leak credentials through skill source. Auth lives in the connector's identity-merge layer, not in the call site.

If the work feels deterministic and reproducible — a fixed parse, a fixed API call, a fixed shell pipeline — it's a tool. The skill body should invoke that tool via `$`, not re-implement it.

Examples that almost certainly belong outside the skill body:
- `get-jira-ticket` — wrap in an MCP server, dispatch via `$ jira.get_ticket`
- `run-linter-before-commit` — git pre-commit hook, not a skill
- `parse-csv-with-known-shape` — connector method, not skill orchestration
- Anything described by "always do exactly these N steps with no branching" — that's a function, not a skill

### Describe when the skill should be invoked, not what it does

The `# Description:` header determines whether agents pick the right skill when multiple are available. A vague description ("Handles error responses") is roughly useless for invocation selection. A specific description ("Read `references/api-errors.md` if a downstream API returns non-200 status") fires the skill at exactly the right moment.

Write descriptions as *trigger conditions*: "if X happens, run this." Not as summaries. Authors who think of the description as the skill's elevator pitch produce skills that never get picked because the trigger condition isn't stated.

This matters at scale. When a skill library grows past ~20 skills, the difference between "agents find the right skill" and "agents waste effort discovering the wrong one" is description-quality discipline. Lint advisories may flag generic descriptions (`description-too-generic`) in future versions.

## Ops reference — the eight typed operations

Each op character starts the body of a line, after leading indent. The language has eight typed operations, each with distinct semantics, grammar, and execution behavior.

## Shipped ops

### `$` — tool invocation (MCP dispatch)

Calls a tool through a configured `McpConnector`. Bare-name `$ <tool> kwarg=value` routes through the `primary` connector; dotted `$ <connector>.<tool>` routes through a named connector. Output binds to `$(target.output)` by default; `-> VAR` explicitly names the binding.

```
$ memorystore.write summary="..." detail="..." scope=private -> ACK
$ personal.write_note title="..." body="$(SUMMARY)"
```

Tool args are unconstrained `key=value` pairs — the connector forwards them to the underlying MCP tool. If `$` returns `isError: true`, the executor throws via `makeOpError`, which routes through `else:` / `# OnError:` fallback machinery if declared. The inner tool's error text is preserved in `result.errors[]`.

### `~` — local-model call

Invokes a configured `LocalModel` connector. **Strict-keyword grammar**: only `prompt` (required), `model` (optional, defaults to `"default"` instance), and `maxTokens` (optional int) are accepted. Anything else is a parse error.

```
~ prompt="Classify: $(INPUT)" -> VERDICT
~ prompt="Decompose into atoms: $(DOC)" model=long-context maxTokens=2000 -> ATOMS
```

Authors interpolate context via `$(...)` substitution inside the prompt string. Response binds to the named variable. Bundled LocalModel instances are deployment-specific; the Connectors section documents the registry shape and how to name instances by tier (e.g., a small batch-classification model vs. a longer-context interactive model).

### `>` — typed retrieval

Resolves through a configured `MemoryStore` connector. All-keyword grammar with `query`, `mode`, `limit` required. Additional keys forward to the connector as `QueryFilters` extra fields. Returns `PortableMemory[]` bound to the named variable.

```
> mode=fts query="$(TOPIC)" limit=5 -> RESULTS
> mode=rerank query="auth flow" limit=3 connector=project -> CANDIDATES
```

### `@` — shell exec

Runs a shell command and binds its stdout to the target output (or an explicit `-> VAR`). The op has two modes — the default safe sandbox, and an opt-in `unsafe` mode for irreducible shell-pipeline cases.

#### Default mode: structured-spawn sandbox

**Grammar bound is the safety.** One binary per `@` op. Args parsed structurally — no shell metacharacter interpretation (no `bash -c`, no `$VAR` expansion by the shell, no pipes, no redirects, no control flow keywords). The structural constraints ARE the security model; there is no PATH allowlist in v1 because the grammar prevents arbitrary command construction. Allowlist becomes per-deployment config if real operational risk surfaces.

```
@ curl -s "wttr.in/$(LOCATION|url)?format=j1" -> RAW
@ git status -> STATUS
```

stdout binds to the variable. Non-zero exit → op-error routed through `else:` / `# OnError:` machinery; stderr preserved in `result.errors[]`. Per-op timeout via the unified abort path (SIGKILL on the child process group when timeout fires).

For multi-step shell logic, decompose into multiple `@` ops with intermediate variable bindings, or push the work into an MCP tool dispatched via `$`. If genuinely unavoidable, see the unsafe mode below — but expect lint friction every time.

In the agent-mediated path (compiled prompt + agent execution), the agent runs the command via its Bash tool. Same input/output semantics either path.

#### Opt-in unsafe mode: `@ unsafe <command>`

When `unsafe` is the literal first token of an `@` op, the op switches to **full-shell exec** — all metacharacters, pipes, redirects, and control flow available. The verbosity is deliberate: the word "unsafe" appears at every dangerous call site, surfaceable by reviewers via grep.

```
@ unsafe for i in $(seq 1 10); do echo $i; done
@ unsafe curl -s example.com | jq '.field' > /tmp/out
```

**Three safety layers stack on top of the keyword:**
1. **Lint flags every `@ unsafe` op as tier-2** (requires human review before storage).
2. **Runtime refuses** with `UnsafeShellDisabledError` unless the deployment sets `runtime.enable_unsafe_shell = true` — default is `false`.
3. **Audit-visible** at every fire — the audit trail records the op + the resolved command string.

Output binding, error handling, and per-op timeout are the same as the default mode.

##### Substitution syntax collision: `$(VAR)` vs `$$(bash-command)`

Inside `@ unsafe`, the bash `$(command)` command-substitution syntax visually collides with skillscript's own `$(VAR)` variable substitution. The language disambiguates with an explicit escape:

- `$(NAME)` — **skillscript variable**. Substituted before the op fires. `NAME` must resolve to a declared variable (or ambient ref, or target output binding). Unresolved `$(NAME)` triggers a lint warning by default.
- `$$(command)` — **bash command-substitution**. The `$$` escape tells the skillscript parser "leave this `$` alone; emit it literally to bash." Bash then sees `$(command)` and substitutes normally.

```
@ unsafe cp $(SOURCE) /tmp/backup-$$(date +%s)
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                    bash command-substitution
        ^^^^^^^^^                                 (skillscript var)
```

**Lint rule `unsafe-shell-ambiguous-subst` (tier-2):** any `$(NAME)` inside an `@ unsafe` body where `NAME` doesn't resolve to a declared skillscript variable fires the rule. Diagnostic offers both candidates:

```
warning: unsafe-shell-ambiguous-subst (tier-2)
  @ unsafe rm -f /tmp/cache-$(date +%s)
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^
'date' isn't a declared variable. Did you mean:
  - bash command-substitution: $$(date +%s)
  - skillscript variable:       $(<some declared var>)
review intent at the call site before admission.
```

The escape is a one-character delta (`$$` vs `$`) but the diagnostic catches every accidental misuse. Authors who explicitly want bash command-substitution write `$$(...)` and the lint stays quiet. The lint's job is to surface intent ambiguity, not to second-guess deliberate intent.

### `!` — tell user

Emits a message to the agent's response surface. Substitutions resolved at runtime; no return value.

```
! Found settings at $(find_settings.output)
```

`!` ordering within a block: ops execute sequentially in source order. `!` can appear before or after `$`/`~`/`>` ops in the same target.

### `??` — ask user

Prompts the user for input; binds the response to a variable.

```
?? "Approve fix A+B?" -> APPROVED
```

**Autonomous mode** (cron/event-fired): `??` fails fast — routes to `else:` or `# OnError:` fallback.

**Interactive mode**: response binds to the output variable. **Decline semantics:** when the user response is "no"/"n"/falsey, dependent targets are skipped (treated as soft op-error so `else:` fires). This is the resolution of Open Spec Question #2 — silent fall-through to subsequent gated targets was the security-bug pattern; bind-AND-short-circuit closes it cleanly.

### `$set` — explicit variable binding

Binds a literal value to a variable. Compiler-side outer-quote stripping. No `$(REF)` substitution on RHS — literals only.

```
$set RESULT = ""
$set MODE = "production"
```

## Deprecated ops

### `?` — agent reasoning step (DEPRECATED, compile-warn v1, compile-error v1.x)

Asks an agent to reason about its current context and produce an output. The legacy form is bare `?` with the reasoning task implied by the surrounding block name, dependencies' outputs, and `# Use when:` metadata.

**Why deprecated:** the bare `?` form synthesizes its task implicitly from surrounding context. This makes skill behavior dependent on context that's not visible in the skill source — a load-bearing design choice that the PRD's architectural commitments reject. Every skill using bare `?` is silently affected when the backing model changes, when surrounding block names are renamed, or when dependency outputs shift shape.

**Deprecation timeline:**
- **v1:** compile-warn on every `?` op. Skills compile and execute, but the warning surfaces at every authoring/admission step.
- **v1.x:** compile-error. Bare `?` no longer admits to the library.

**Compile-warn diagnostic** (v1):
```
warning: ? is deprecated and will be a compile-error in v1.x
  decide:
      ? -> VERDICT
      ^^^
rewrite as: ~ prompt="<explicit reasoning task>" -> VERDICT
the implicit-context form makes skill behavior depend on context that's
not visible in the skill source. Replace with an explicit prompt that
captures what the reasoning task is doing.
```

The rewrite is `~` (LocalModel call) with an explicit prompt. The prompt captures what `?` was doing implicitly — "decide whether to escalate", "classify this input", "summarize the result". Any author or agent who hits the warning gets the exact rewrite shape in the diagnostic.

## Pending ops

### `&` — skill invocation

Invokes another skill at execution time. Resolution: skill-name lookup against the configured `SkillStore`. The invoked skill compiles independently, executes, and returns its output bound to the named variable.

```
& mailbox-triage scope=last-12h -> TRIAGE
```

Open: output binding semantics — what does the bound variable contain? Probable answer: the `default:` target's output of the called skill. To be made explicit when the op ships.

## Op grammar summary

| Op | Shape | Routes through | Output binding |
|----|-------|----------------|----------------|
| `$` | `$ [connector.]tool kwarg=value...` | `McpConnector.call()` | `-> VAR` or `$(target.output)` |
| `~` | `~ prompt="..." [model=name] [maxTokens=N]` | `LocalModel.run()` | `-> VAR` (required) |
| `>` | `> query=... mode=... limit=N [extra=...]` | `MemoryStore.query()` | `-> VAR` (required) |
| `@` | `@ <binary> <args>...` | structured spawn sandbox | `-> VAR` or `$(target.output)` |
| `@ unsafe` | `@ unsafe <shell command>` | full shell exec (gated by `runtime.enable_unsafe_shell`) | `-> VAR` or `$(target.output)` |
| `!` | `! <text with $(SUBS)>` | response surface | none |
| `??` | `?? "<prompt>"` | response surface (interactive) | `-> VAR` (required) |
| `$set` | `$set NAME = value` | compile-time binding | `NAME` (no arrow) |
| `?` | DEPRECATED — rewrite as `~ prompt="..."` | — | — |
| `&` | `& <skill-name> kwarg=value...` (pending) | SkillStore-name resolver | `-> VAR` |

## Variable resolution — substitution, ambient refs, # Requires: cascade

Skillscript supports four tiers of variables, each with distinct resolution timing and scope.

## Tier 1: Ambient

Injected automatically at runtime; never declared by the author.

| Var | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `$(NOW)` | Current timestamp |
| `$(USER)` | The configured user identity |
| `$(SESSION_CONTEXT)` | Current session-scope context (project/entity/etc., substrate-defined) |
| `$(TRIGGER_TYPE)` | What event fired this skill (v2) |
| `$(TRIGGER_PAYLOAD)` | Event-specific data (v2) |
| `$(EVENT.*)` | Event-payload fields populated by the trigger source (v2) |
| `$(ERROR_CONTEXT)` | In `# OnError:` fallback skills: type + target where failure occurred |

Iterator vars from `foreach` and output bindings from `>` / `~` also pass through ambient at compile time; the runtime substitutes them per iteration / per op completion.

For cron and session triggers, the scheduler injects time-offset ambient fields onto `$(EVENT.*)`:
- `$(EVENT.fired_at)` — milliseconds since Unix epoch
- `$(EVENT.fired_at_unix)` — seconds since Unix epoch
- `$(EVENT.fired_at_plus_1h_unix)` — `fired_at_unix + 3600`
- `$(EVENT.fired_at_plus_1d_unix)` — `fired_at_unix + 86400`
- `$(EVENT.fired_at_plus_7d_unix)` — `fired_at_unix + 604800`

These let skill bodies compute `expires_at` and similar bounded-lifetime values without needing arithmetic in op kwargs.

Additional ambient refs may be injected by the runtime based on connector configuration (e.g., a vault-backed MemoryStore may expose `$(VAULT_ROOT)`; a sensor-enabled deployment may expose `$(SENSOR.*)`). The Connectors section documents which ambient refs each connector contributes.

## Tier 2: Input

Required at invocation; declared in `# Vars:` without a default. Compile fails cleanly if missing.

```
# Vars: NOTE_PATH, TOPIC
```

## Tier 3: Default

Optional input with fallback declared inline.

```
# Vars: FORMAT=prompt, UNITS=imperial
```

Bracketed list literals supported (`# Vars: TAGS=[a, b, c]`).

**Parser convention:** comma splitting in `# Vars:` respects bracket depth. Commas inside `[]`, `()`, and `{}` do not terminate values. `# Vars: TAGS=[a, b], MODE=fast` parses as two declarations (`TAGS=[a, b]` and `MODE=fast`); the inner comma is preserved as a list element separator.

## Tier 4: Local

Bound to a previous target's output mid-execution. Two forms:
- `$(target.output)` — the bound output of a target
- `$(VAR)` — an explicit `-> VAR` binding from any op
- `$(target.output.field)` or `$(MEMORY.field)` — dotted field access into structured output

**Field access resolution tiers** for `$(MEMORY.field)`:
1. Core `PortableMemory` fields (id, summary, detail, score)
2. Curated substrate subset (thread_status, pinned, confidence, domain_tags, payload_type, knowledge_type, recipients, expires_at, created_at, agent_id, vault)
3. `metadata.X` for everything else
4. Ambient passthrough as literal `$(MEMORY.field)` if unresolved

## Resolution order

In `compileSkill`, variables resolve in priority order:
1. Caller inputs (passed in at compile time)
2. `# Requires:` cascade
3. `# Vars:` defaults
4. Ambient passthrough (left as `$(NAME)` for runtime substitution)
5. Missing → compile error

## `# Requires:` cascade (shipped)

Pulls values from the configured data-source backend at compile time. One declaration per line. Both `→` (Unicode) and `->` (ASCII) accepted.

```
# Requires: user-var:location -> LOCATION (fallback: ip-based)
# Requires: system-var:morning-brief-delivered -> DELIVERED (fallback: false)
```

Resolution cascade by namespace:
- `user-var:<key>` — `user-var:<key>` record → `user-profile.<key>` JSON key → declared fallback
- `system-var:<key>` — `system-var:<key>` record → declared fallback (no profile tier)

Lookups query data records in the calling agent's private scope, filtered by tag, respecting expiration. Caller-supplied `# Vars:` inputs short-circuit the cascade for any matching target name. The specific backend lookup semantics (DB query, file read, KV lookup) are defined by the configured data-source connector.

**Vars-namespace conventions** (data records, private scope):
- `user-profile` — single JSON blob per agent, no expiry, static facts
- `user-var:<key>` — dynamic per-key record, typically with expiration
- `system-var:<key>` — agent/process state flags

## `$set` — explicit variable binding

The `$set` op binds a literal value to a variable at runtime. Literal RHS only (no `$(REF)` substitution on RHS). Compiler-side outer-quote stripping (`"foo"` and `'foo'` both stripped; whitespace inside quotes preserved verbatim).

```
$set RESULT = ""
$set MODE = "production"
```

Useful inside `else:` blocks to provide a fallback value the rest of the skill can consume.

## Scoping rules

- `# Vars:` declarations are skill-global (visible to all targets)
- `-> VAR` bindings are skill-global (visible to all targets after the op runs)
- `foreach IDENT in EXPR:` iterator vars are loop-local — `$set` bindings inside the loop don't persist after the loop ends
- Target outputs (`$(target.output)`) are accessible after the target completes

## Pipe filters — url, shell, json, trim (+ pending head/tail/lines/field/length/summary/pluck)

Pipe filters apply transforms to resolved variables before substitution. Syntax: `$(VAR|filter)`. Filters operate at compile time for static values; for runtime-bound variables, filters apply at substitution time.

## Shipped filters

| Filter | Effect | Example | Output |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| `url` | `encodeURIComponent(value)` | `$(location|url)` for "Asheville, NC" | `Asheville%2C%20NC` |
| `shell` | POSIX single-quote escape with outer quotes | `$(arg|shell)` for `it's safe` | `'it'\''s safe'` |
| `json` | `JSON.stringify(value)` | `$(payload|json)` for `{k:"v"}` | `"{\"k\":\"v\"}"` |
| `trim` | Whitespace trim | `$(VERDICT|trim)` for `"urgent\n"` | `urgent` |

## Filter chaining

Filters chain left-to-right. The output of each filter becomes input to the next.

```
$(VERDICT|trim|json)
```

First trims whitespace, then JSON-stringifies the result.

## Filter use in conditionals

Filters may appear on the LHS of conditional expressions. Useful for whitespace-tolerant equality checks against LocalModel output (which often has trailing newlines).

```
if $(VERDICT|trim) == "urgent":
    ...
```

## Filter use in `in` / `not in` set membership

Filters may appear on the LHS of `in` / `not in` checks (the comparison side). The RHS must resolve to an array at runtime.

```
if $(M.id|trim) in $(SEEN):
    ! already processed
```

## Error handling

Unknown filter on a resolved variable produces a compile-time error. Filter chains that fail at runtime (e.g., `|json` on a non-serializable value) produce op errors that route through `else:` / `# OnError:` machinery.

Bare `$(NAME)` without a filter is unchanged.

## Pending filters (v2/v3)

Several filters are planned but not yet shipped:

| Filter | Effect | Use case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `head:N` | First N lines | Truncate long output for embedding in prompts |
| `tail:N` | Last N lines | Recent log entries |
| `lines:M-N` | Range of lines | Specific slice |
| `field:N` | Nth whitespace-separated field | Awk-like extraction |
| `length` | Count of items (array) or chars (string) | Numeric comparison in conditions (paired with future numeric grammar) |
| `summary` | One-line abbreviation | Compress for human-facing emissions |
| `pluck:<field>` | Project array of objects to array of field values | Paired with `in`/`not in` for dedup-by-id workflows |

`pluck` is the highest-priority pending filter — it closes the structural-dedup gap for skills that iterate retrieval results and want to exclude already-seen items by ID without manual comparison loops.

## Composition philosophy

Filters are pure functions (input → output, no side effects). Stay small and orthogonal — each filter does one thing. Composition emerges from chaining, not from elaborate per-filter parameter spaces. The shipped set covers ~80% of real-world string-shaping needs; the pending set extends to array projection and numeric work.

## Conditionals & iteration — if/elif/else, foreach, supported operators

Skillscript supports narrow conditionals and bounded iteration. Both are deliberately constrained — composition over expressiveness.

## Conditionals

`if COND:` / `elif COND:` / `else:` chain. Supported condition shapes:

### Truthy

```
if $(VAR):
    ! VAR was set and non-empty
```

### Equality

`==` and `!=` against either quoted string literals or another `$(...)` ref. Filters and dotted-field access are permitted on either side.

```
if $(VERDICT) == "urgent":
    ...
elif $(VERDICT) != "quiet":
    ...
```

```
if $(FP|trim) == $(LAST_FP|trim):
    ! no change since last scan
elif $(M.id) != $(LAST_ID):
    ! drift detected
```

The ref-vs-ref form is the canonical change-detection pattern. Both sides resolve to strings at evaluation time; equality is byte-for-byte after filter application. No type coercion — `$(N) == "42"` compares the string form of N against the literal `"42"`, even if N is "numeric" elsewhere in the connector layer.

### Set membership (v2, shipped 2026-05-13)

```
if $(M.id|trim) in $(SEEN):
    ! already processed
elif $(M.id) not in $(SEEN):
    $ memorystore.write summary="..." detail="..."
```

Both sides are explicit refs. RHS must resolve to an array at runtime; clean error otherwise. LHS-undefined evaluates to `false` for both polarities. Optional filter on LHS.

**JSON-string tolerance on RHS** (added 2026-05-21): if the RHS resolves to a *string* that successfully JSON-parses to an array, the parsed array is used. This accommodates the canonical pattern where the array comes from a `~` op that prompted for JSON output:

```
~ prompt="List the URGENT memory IDs as a JSON array of strings. Items: $(M|json)" -> SEEN

foreach M in $(MEMORIES):
    if $(M.id) in $(SEEN):
        ! flagged urgent
```

`$(SEEN)` resolves to a string like `["abc", "def"]`; runtime JSON-parses, sees an array, uses it. Strings that don't JSON-parse to an array still error per the strict rule — only valid JSON arrays get the tolerance.

### What's NOT supported

- *No arithmetic comparison* — no `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`. (Pending: numeric grammar + `|length` filter would unlock this.)
- *No `and`/`or` combinators* — compose via nested `if` blocks instead. The line where composition forces a real parser hasn't been crossed.
- *No filter math* — filters apply to substitution, not to condition evaluation arithmetic.
- *No single-`=` assignment-in-condition* — this isn't a feature, it's a parse error. See below.

**Common parse error: single `=` in conditional position.** A single `=` in an `if`/`elif` condition is a parse error with a specific diagnostic:

```
error: '=' is not valid in a condition; use '==' for equality
  if $(VERDICT) = "urgent":
                ^
rewrite as: if $(VERDICT) == "urgent":
```

The grammar doesn't admit single-`=` in condition position at all — the parser catches the construction via a specific error production rather than failing with a generic "syntax error." Skillscript condition equality is always two-character `==`; single-`=` is the JavaScript-shaped bug pattern this rule blocks at parse time.

### Disambiguation: `else:` after target body vs `else:` after `if:`

Both shapes use the keyword `else:`. Distinguished by parser scope-stack at parse time:
- `else:` after a target's primary body → error handler (runs when any op in the body errors). See Error handling section.
- `else:` after `if:` / `elif:` chain → conditional branch.

Both can coexist in the same target. Conformance suite includes regression tests demonstrating both parse correctly without ambiguity.

## Iteration: `foreach`

`foreach IDENT in EXPR:` block iterates over a list, binding `IDENT` to each item per iteration. Body indented under the header; indent-based dedent returns to outer scope.

```
foreach M in $(RESULTS):
    ! Processing $(M.id) — $(M.summary)
    if $(M.id|trim) not in $(SEEN):
        $ memorystore.update id=$(M.id) pinned=true -> ACK
```

### Iterator vars

`$(M)` and `$(M.field)` pass through ambient at compile; runtime substitutes per iteration. Dotted field access against `PortableMemory` shape applies (core fields → curated subset → metadata).

### Loop-local scope

`$set` bindings inside the loop don't persist after the loop ends. Each iteration starts fresh from the loop binding.

### What's NOT supported

- *No `while` loop* — iteration is bounded by the iterable's length. Unbounded loops are not expressible.
- *No `break` or `continue`* — every iteration runs to completion. Filter the iterable beforehand if you need exclusion.
- *No nested-loop variable capture* — inner-loop `$set` doesn't escape to outer scope.

## Composition philosophy

The grammar is deliberately narrow. The threshold for adding new grammar (numeric comparison, `and`/`or`, `while`, `break`) is "an authored skill demonstrates the gap is load-bearing." Composition through nested blocks + filter chains covers most real cases.

Ref-vs-ref equality and JSON-string `in` RHS tolerance were both added in 2026-05-21 because cold-context agents authoring against the spec reached for them as canonical patterns (change-detection for the former, JSON-array-from-LLM for the latter) — exactly the "authored skill demonstrates the gap is load-bearing" trigger. Future grammar extensions follow the same discipline: surfaced by real authoring need, not by speculative completeness.

Authors writing complex conditional logic should consider:
- *Push the logic into a `~` LocalModel call* — let the model classify, return a one-word verdict, branch on equality
- *Push the logic into a connector* — wrap the complex check as an MCP tool, dispatch via `$`
- *Decompose into multiple skills* via `&` invocation (when shipped)

Skills are orchestration, not computation. When the conditional logic feels Turing-complete, the work belongs in a connector.

## Triggers — # Triggers: header, declarative + imperative registration, source types

Triggers declare what events fire a skill autonomously. A skill without triggers must be invoked explicitly (via a compile/execute API call); a skill with triggers fires automatically when matching events occur.

## Declarative registration via `# Triggers:` header

The skill body declares triggers via metadata header. Multiple triggers permitted, comma-separated or one per line.

```
# Triggers: cron: 0 8 * * *, session: start
```

On skill write, the runtime's trigger registry parses the header and auto-registers each trigger. Editing the skill body updates registrations.

## Imperative registration

For dynamic, one-shot, or runtime-decided triggers, use the imperative `registerTrigger` API:

```
registerTrigger({
  skill_name: "my-skill",
  source: "cron",
  name: "55 2 * * *",
  expires_at: 1779107400  // optional auto-cleanup
})
```

Imperative triggers default to a 30-day expiration (cleanup via expiry sweep). Pass `null` for indefinite retention; author must clean up via the corresponding `unregisterTrigger` API.

## Trigger sources

### `cron: <expression>` — time-based (shipped)

Standard 5-field cron. Sliding-window evaluation by a 30s poll loop. No catch-up replay if the runtime was down at fire time.

```
# Triggers: cron: 0 3 * * *
```

### `session: start | end` — session lifecycle hooks (shipped)

Fires when an agent session begins (`session: start`) or ends (`session: end`). The load-bearing primitive for prepping context at session boundaries — a session-start skill produces `prompt-context:` output that prepends to the next inference.

```
# Triggers: session: start
# Output: prompt-context: <agent-name>
```

### `event: <event-name>` — runtime-host-emitted events (parse-only, dispatch pending)

Header parses, but the event bus that would emit `event:` triggers isn't wired yet. Phase 2 work.

Example event categories (deployment-defined):
- `event: thread.replied` — a thread receives a new reply
- `event: mailbox.dangle` — an addressed item expires unprocessed
- `event: classifier.flagged` — a background classifier surfaces an urgent finding
- (extensible via runtime-host event registration)

### `agent-event: <agent>.<event>` — cross-agent event hooks (parse-only)

Subscribes to another agent's events. Same phase-2 dispatch status as `event:`.

```
# Triggers: agent-event: builder.task.completed
```

### `file-watch: <path>` — filesystem change (parse-only)

Fires when the named path changes. Relies on inotify (Linux) or kqueue (macOS) on the host. Phase 2.

Open spec question: recursive vs directory-only default. Current lean: directory-only by default, opt-in via `file-watch-recursive:` or `file-watch: <path> (recursive)`.

### `sensor: <sensor-name>` — external sensor stream (parse-only)

Extension surface for multimodal inputs — camera, microphone, presence, screen state. Designed as a category distinct from tools: sensors are continuous channels the agent reads but doesn't emit on. Privacy gating is a structural precondition.

```
# Triggers: sensor: presence
```

Phase 3 work (per the original v2 roadmap).

## Trigger context

When a skill fires from a trigger, the runtime populates ambient refs accessible inside the skill body:

- `$(TRIGGER_TYPE)` — the trigger source (`cron`, `session`, etc.)
- `$(TRIGGER_PAYLOAD)` — source-specific data
- `$(EVENT.*)` — event-payload fields for `event:` / `agent-event:` triggers

## Trigger lifecycle

- **Registration:** declarative via header (auto on skill write) or imperative via the `registerTrigger` API
- **Storage:** registered triggers are records owned by the registering agent, indexed by source + name + agent_id + skill_id; the storage backend is connector-defined
- **Inspection:** `listTriggers({ skill_name?, agent_id?, source? })` returns the live registry
- **Archival:** `unregisterTrigger(trigger_id)` archives the trigger (audit trail preserved); declarative triggers are removed by editing the skill body to drop the declaration

## Multiple triggers

A skill may declare multiple triggers; each fires an independent execution. The compiled output is identical regardless of trigger; the runtime distinguishes via `$(TRIGGER_TYPE)`.

Open spec question: dedup on near-simultaneous fires. If `cron: 0 8 * * *` and `event: user.present` both fire within seconds, the runtime currently runs the skill twice (one per trigger). Author dedups via state if needed. Affects the dispatch layer.

## Output targets — # Output: header, delivery kinds

The `# Output:` header declares where a skill's result is delivered. Default behavior (no header) is `text` — return string to caller.

## Output kinds

### `text` (default, bare-only)

Returns the skill's result as a string to whatever invoked the skill via API or read the compiled prompt artifact. Bare-only — no target accepted; parse error if a target is supplied.

```
# Output: text
```

### `slack: <channel>` — Slack delivery

Posts to a Slack channel. Routes through the runtime's notification dispatch.

```
# Output: slack: <channel-name>
```

Phase-2 — header parses, dispatch routing pending implementation.

### `prompt-context: <agent>` — prepend to next-turn prompt context (shipped)

The load-bearing primitive for "hot-ready" briefings. Output prepends to the named agent's next-turn prompt context as a `<skill_output>` block.

```
# Output: prompt-context: <agent-name>
```

Used to bring an agent into the next turn pre-shaped — context that would normally require a session-start retrieval is pre-positioned in the prompt header. Wired end-to-end via the runtime host's prompt-prepend surface + a synchronous trigger-fire endpoint with timeout-fallback so the next-turn dispatch isn't blocked on slow skill execution.

### `file: <path>` — write to file

Writes output to a filesystem path. Phase-2 — header parses, file router pending.

### `card: <spec>` — structured UI card

Renders output as a structured card to the appropriate UI surface. Phase-2 — pending host UI card-render surface.

### `none` (bare-only)

Side-effects only — the skill's purpose is the writes / shell ops it performs, not the returned value. Bare-only; parse error if a target is supplied.

```
# Output: none
```

## Multiple output targets

A skill may declare multiple output targets, one per line. Each target receives the same content.

```
# Output: slack: ops-channel
# Output: prompt-context: assistant
```

A morning-brief skill, for example, can post to a team Slack channel and prepend to an assistant agent's session-start prompt context simultaneously.

## Per-kind output value semantics (shipped 2026-05-12)

Different output kinds consume the skill's execution result differently:

- **Presentation surfaces** (`slack:`, `prompt-context:`, `card:`) consume joined emissions — all `!` ops in the skill body concatenated in execution order
- **Programmatic surfaces** (`text`, `file:`) consume the `lastBoundVar` — the most recently bound `-> VAR` value from any op

Single source of truth in the executor's `perKindOutput()` function; routers stay dumb (just consume what the executor hands them per kind).

## Grammar

- Kinds with no target (`text`, `none`) are bare-only — `# Output: text` is valid, `# Output: text: anything` is a parse error.
- Kinds with a target (`slack`, `prompt-context`, `file`, `card`) require `<kind>: <target>` — `# Output: slack` without a target is a parse error.
- Authoring friction-fix: parse errors on bare-only kinds suggest the corrected shape inline.

## Output routing failures

If `# Output: slack: <channel>` and Slack is down, the runtime's behavior is currently unspecified. Spec question: queue-and-retry, error-to-caller, or silent best-effort? Pending decision. Affects dispatch layer.

## Lifecycle and status — # Status: header, six canonical states, compile + runtime enforcement

Skillscripts carry an explicit lifecycle state via the `# Status:` header. The compiler and runtime enforce status — a Disabled skillscript cannot fire under any path, regardless of who invokes it.

## Header syntax

```
# Skill: support-response-draft
# Status: Approved
# Description: ...
```

If `# Status:` is omitted, the default state is **Draft**. This forces authors to explicitly promote a skillscript through its lifecycle rather than relying on "newly written = ready for use."

**Case normalization:** Status values are accepted case-insensitively on input and stored as canonical form. `# Status: draft`, `# Status: Draft`, `# Status: DRAFT` all parse to canonical `Draft`. Per the Section 1 lexical convention, this principle applies across all enumerated frontmatter value spaces.

## The three canonical states (v1)

- **Draft** — being authored or under revision; not ready for production use. Compile warns; runtime refuses unless explicitly invoked with `--force-draft` for the author's own testing. Triggers don't fire under default dispatch.
- **Approved** — passed authoring + lint and is ready to fire. The canonical "in use" state. Compile is clean; runtime allows everywhere; declared triggers fire freely.
- **Disabled** — explicitly off. Compile rejects; runtime rejects; triggers don't fire. Source and version history preserved, but the skillscript cannot execute under any path.

These three states have crisp, universal operational meaning across every deployment. Every operator understands what each state means; no judgment calls about edge-case distinctions.

## Compile + runtime behavior table

| State | Compile | Runtime invocation | Test harness | Default trigger fire |
|-------|---------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Draft | warn | refuse (unless `--force-draft`) | allow (with flag) | refuse |
| Approved | OK | allow | allow | allow |
| Disabled | refuse | refuse | refuse | refuse |

## Trigger registry interaction

The trigger registry respects status. A skillscript in Draft or Disabled state has its declared triggers held in a non-firing state — the trigger is registered (visible via `listTriggers`) but the scheduler skips dispatch. This lets authors register triggers while still in Draft mode without risking accidental production fires.

When a skillscript transitions to Approved, its triggers activate. When it transitions to Disabled, its triggers deactivate.

## State transitions

For v1, status transitions are freeform — any author with write authority on the skillscript can flip the status by editing the header. v2 may add transition rules (Draft → Approved with lint-pass requirement; Disabled requiring admin-level permission) once a real authorship-permissions story is in place.

## Audit trail

Status changes are visible via the storage substrate's versioning. For memory-backed skillscripts, each header change is a new record revision; the version history shows the lifecycle. For file-backed skillscripts, status changes show up in git history. The audit trail is part of the substrate, not part of the language.

## States deferred from v1

Three additional states were considered for v1 and deferred — each is cheap to add later when justified by real operational need:

- **Test** — distinct "passed compile but not production-ready" state. In v1, Draft covers this case (same behavior — refuse to fire under default dispatch). If authors find Draft and Test are operationally distinct in practice, Test ships then.
- **Deployed** — distinct "currently shipping" state separate from Approved. In v1, Approved + active triggers IS deployed; no operational difference. If a deployment finds Approved-vs-Deployed meaningfully different (e.g., a release-gating workflow that distinguishes "ready" from "live"), Deployed ships then.
- **Deprecated** — soft-warn state for "still works but new authoring should use a successor." In v1, deprecation is carried in metadata (`deprecated: true` in frontmatter) + a lint warning at invocation sites. When deprecated skills accumulate enough that the metadata pattern is awkward, Deprecated promotes to a first-class state.

Adding states is additive — existing skills with the three-state model continue to work when new states are added.

## Why this matters

The lifecycle states are the language's answer to operational safety at scale. A traditional "all skillscripts compile and run" model relies on author discipline to keep broken or untested work out of production. Status states enforce the discipline at the language level — a Disabled skill cannot fire even if every author downstream forgets it's broken. The constraint IS the safety story, here as elsewhere.

## Open questions

- **Status + composition.** When a procedural skillscript references a data skill via `&`, what happens if the data skill is Disabled? Probable answer: compile-time error if any referenced skill is Disabled. Specify when `&` ships.
- **Bulk status operations.** "Disable all skills tagged with project:legacy" is a useful operational primitive. v2 may add a `skillscript bulk-status <pattern> <state>` CLI affordance.

## Error handling — else: blocks, # OnError: fallback, op-level fallback values

Skillscript provides three layers of error handling, working from local to global. All three shipped in v1.

## Layer 1: Target-level `else:` block

Runs if any op in the target's primary body errors. Local to the failing target. Downstream targets that depend on this one can still proceed using whatever the `else:` branch produced.

```
fetch:
    > mode=fts query=$(TOPIC) limit=5 -> RESULT
else:
    ! retrieval failed, falling back to empty result
    $set RESULT = ""
```

### Distinguished from conditional `else:`

The keyword `else:` is shared between two purposes:
- Conditional `else:` — appears after `if:` / `elif:` chain inside a target body
- Target `else:` — appears as a sibling block after a target's primary body, as an error handler

The parser's scope-stack discriminates at parse time. Both kinds coexist in the same target.

### Constraint

`else:` blocks may not declare their own error handlers (no nested catch). If an `else:` block fails, the whole target fails through `# OnError:` if present.

## Layer 2: Skill-level `# OnError:` header

Names a fallback skill to invoke if anything in the skill fails — including target-level errors that aren't caught by `else:`, compile errors, or the executing context running out of resources.

```
# Skill: morning-brief
# OnError: morning-brief-degraded
```

Compile-time existence check — fails clean if the referenced fallback doesn't exist. The fallback skill is itself a skill (same compilation, same execution model) and can do real work (file an issue, post an ack, write a degraded result, etc.).

The fallback skill receives:
- The same inputs as the failing skill
- An additional `$(ERROR_CONTEXT)` ambient ref containing the error type and the target where it failed

### Constraint

Nested `# OnError:` is *not* supported. If `# OnError: degraded-skill` fires and `degraded-skill` itself errors, the runtime hard-exits with no further fallback. Spec is explicit on this.

## Layer 3: Op-level fallback values for `$`, `>`, and `~`

Inline fallback declared on the op line. Used when the call fails or returns empty. Supported on all three dispatch ops (`$` MCP tools, `>` retrieval, `~` LocalModel) with identical coerce-on-bind semantics.

```
weather:
    > mode=fts query="weather $(LOCATION)" limit=1 -> CURRENT (fallback: "weather unavailable")
    ~ prompt="Summarize: $(CURRENT)" -> SUMMARY (fallback: "summary unavailable")
    $ slack.post channel=$(CHANNEL) text=$(SUMMARY) (fallback: "post failed silently") -> ACK
```

Same pattern as the `# Requires:` cascade's `(fallback: ...)` syntax — consistent across compile-time (`# Requires:`) and runtime (`$` / `>` / `~`).

**Fallback value parsing.** Permissive: bare identifiers, quoted strings, and bracketed array literals all accepted. Matches the `# Requires:` cascade convention.

```
> ... -> RESULTS (fallback: [])              # array literal
~ ... -> VERDICT (fallback: unknown)         # bare identifier
$ ... -> ACK (fallback: "post failed")       # quoted string
```

**Coerce-on-bind semantics.** On op throw or empty-result, the fallback value is bound to the outputVar via the same path as a successful result. Downstream targets see the fallback transparently — they don't need conditional checks to detect "did this op fail?" The op-level fallback IS the default-on-failure value.

`$` was added to Layer 3 in 2026-05-21 (originally `~`/`>` only). Symmetry with the other dispatch ops; cold-context agents reached for the pattern on `$` ops as the natural extension of the documented behavior. Spec catch-up to authoring reality.

## Error propagation rules

- Op error → caught by `else:` if present, otherwise propagates to target
- Target error → caught by `# OnError:` if present, otherwise propagates to caller
- Caller can still catch via standard exception handling on compile / runtime invocation APIs
- `else:` blocks are not allowed to declare their own error handlers
- If an `else:` block itself fails, the whole target fails through `# OnError:` (if present)

## Visibility into errors

Open spec question: should `$(ERROR)` be ambient inside `else:` blocks (same shape as `$(ERROR_CONTEXT)` in `# OnError:` fallbacks)? Current lean: yes. Useful for telemetry skills that need to know what failed before falling back. Not yet specified or shipped.

## The fallback pattern is consistent across scopes

Same idea at every scope:
- Compile-time: `# Requires: ... (fallback: value)`
- Runtime op: `$`, `>`, `~` all accept `(fallback: value)` with identical semantics
- Runtime target: `else:` block
- Whole skill: `# OnError:` header

Authors composing complex skills use these in combination — op-level for transient errors, target-level for cohesive error paths, skill-level for last-resort degradation.

## Connection to runtime observability

Per-op error contract is what makes cascading fallbacks work. When `$` returns `isError: true`, the executor throws via `makeOpError` rather than binding the error text to the output var. The throw routes through `else:` / `# OnError:` machinery and surfaces in `result.errors[]` for the scheduler to log. Without this discipline, op-level failures wouldn't propagate to the fallback layers and silent-fail would be the default.

## Connectors — MemoryStore / LocalModel / McpConnector interfaces, three-layer resolution

The substrate-routing ops (`$`, `>`, `~`) and substrate-routing Output kinds (`prompt-context:`, `template:`) don't call any specific backend directly. They route through thin connector interfaces. Skill source persistence follows the same pattern via a dedicated contract. This is the programmable surface through which authors compose information topology per skill and per moment. Skills are portable across substrates because the language doesn't bake substrate identity into the source.

## Five connector types

### MemoryStore

Routes `>` retrieval ops. Interface: `MemoryStore.query(filters) → PortableMemory[]`.

Implementations vary by deployment — a knowledge-substrate-backed store, a SQLite-backed store, a vector-DB-backed store, an in-memory test store. All conform to the `MemoryStore.query` contract and return `PortableMemory[]`.

### LocalModel

Routes `~` local-model ops. Interface: `LocalModel.run(prompt, opts) → string`.

Default impl wraps a local-model HTTP service (e.g., Ollama). Constructor takes `{ model: string }` (required) — no class-level implicit default. Multiple instances by name in the registry; each backed by a distinct model tag.

### McpConnector

Routes `$` MCP-tool ops. Interface: `McpConnector.call(toolName, args, ctxOverrides?) → unknown`.

Implementations include adapters wrapping in-process tool dispatch (when the runtime is embedded in a host that already has MCP tools) and HTTP-based MCP clients (when calling out to remote MCP servers). All conform to the `McpConnector.call` contract.

### AgentConnector

Routes agent-bound `# Output:` kinds — `prompt-context:` (Augmenting) and `template:` (Template) per the skill-kind taxonomy in Section 1. Interface:

```typescript
interface AgentConnector {
  list_agents(): Promise<AgentDescriptor[]>;
  deliver(agent_id: string, payload: DeliveryPayload): Promise<DeliveryReceipt>;
  wake(agent_id: string, opts?: WakeOpts): Promise<WakeReceipt>;
  agent_status?(agent_id: string): Promise<AgentStatus>;
}

type DeliveryPayload =
  | { kind: "augment"; content: string; format?: "text" | "markdown" }
  | { kind: "template"; prompt: string; source_skill?: string };

type DeliveryReceipt = { delivered_at: number; delivery_id?: string };

type WakeOpts = {
  context?: string;
  when?: "immediate" | number;
};

type WakeReceipt = { woken_at: number; session_id?: string };

type AgentDescriptor = {
  agent_id: string;
  agent_name?: string;
  capabilities?: ("deliver" | "wake" | "augment" | "template")[];
};

type AgentStatus = "active" | "idle" | "asleep" | "unknown";
```

Two primary verbs (`deliver` + `wake`), one mandatory discovery method (`list_agents`), one optional status method. The contract is substrate-neutral; adopters wire any delivery mechanism behind it:

| Substrate | `deliver` impl | `wake` impl |
|---|---|---|
| tmux session | `tmux send-keys` to a pane | `tmux send-keys` with wake prompt |
| webhook | POST to `/augment` or `/template` endpoint | POST to `/wake` endpoint |
| memory store | write a memory record with delivery tag | write addressed memory + push notification |
| file-watch | write to `<path>/augment-<id>.txt` | write to `<path>/wake-<id>.txt` |
| chat thread | post to monitored thread | post + @mention |
| IPC named pipe | write to delivery pipe | write to wake pipe |

Default impl `NoOpAgentConnector` logs warnings and resolves; lets the runtime ship without an agent-delivery substrate wired. Adopter impls run the bundled `AgentConnectorConformance` suite to verify their substrate wiring.

#### `agent_id` resolution chain

When `# Output: prompt-context:` or `# Output: template:` fires, the runtime resolves the target agent_id via a 4-level chain (first match wins):

1. **Explicit name in `# Output:` line** — `# Output: prompt-context: perry` dispatches to agent_id `perry`. Highest precedence.
2. **Invocation context** — if the skill was invoked from an agent-event trigger or via the runtime API with an `agent_id` context, that becomes the default target. (v0.3.0 — currently parses but auto-inheritance is pending.)
3. **Input var override** — `# Output: prompt-context: $(TARGET_AGENT)` lets the caller pass agent_id via input vars; standard var-resolution rules apply.
4. **Runtime config default** — `default_agent_id` in the runtime config. Used when nothing else resolves.

Same shape as the `# Timeout:` 4-level resolution chain (ERD §6) — one resolution model, applied everywhere.

#### Output-kind classification in the runtime

The runtime's `TEXT_COERCED_OUTPUT_KINDS` set classifies output kinds by payload shape (text vs structured), not by semantic destination. Membership controls payload coercion; it doesn't bake destination identity into the runtime. v1.x: this lifts to a connector-registered metadata pattern via the EmissionConnector design, so adopters can register new text-shaped destinations without runtime code changes.

### SkillStore

Routes skill source persistence. Interface:

```typescript
interface SkillStore {
  get(name: string): Promise<SkillRecord | null>;
  write(name: string, body: string): Promise<void>;
  list(): Promise<SkillDescriptor[]>;
  delete(name: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

Bundled impls: `FilesystemSkillStore` reads and writes `.skill.md` source plus `.skill` compiled output and `.skill.provenance.json` sidecar in a configured directory; the standard for file-backed deployments. Substrate-specific impls live in adopter packages (memory-backed stores live in the substrate's adapter repo).

Skill records are infrastructure, not knowledge atoms — adopter impls should treat skills as first-class long-lived records, not as candidates for substrate-level garbage collection.

## Capabilities discovery

All connector types expose `capabilities()` for runtime discovery. Three consumers:
1. Static `# Requires:` matching (future — pending header enforcement)
2. Dynamic queries via `listMemoryStores()` / `listLocalModels()` / `listMcpConnectors()` / `listAgentConnectors()` to pick a connector for the moment
3. Authoring tools that surface the registered set

## Multi-instance by design

Multiple instances of the same connector type are the *normal case*, not the exception.

```
{
  primary: MemoryStoreImplA,
  project: SqliteProjectStore,
  scratch: InMemoryStore
}
```

```
{
  default: OllamaLocalModel({model: "gemma2:9b"}),
  gemma2:  OllamaLocalModel({model: "gemma2:9b"}),
  qwen:    OllamaLocalModel({model: "qwen2.5:7b"})
}
```

```
{
  primary: PrimaryMcpConnector,
  personal: HttpMcpConnector,
  project: HttpMcpConnector
}
```

Per-skill resolution against named connectors is first-class; an unnamed lookup returns the configured default. Multiple keys pointing at the same underlying instance configuration are allowed and useful — see the `default`/`gemma2` alias below.

## Model selection — choosing among LocalModel instances

The LocalModel registry holds multiple instances by design. Skill authors choose which to dispatch to via `~ model="<name>"`. Two layers of indirection are involved, and the distinction matters for both authoring and adopter configuration:

1. **Skillscript name → registered instance.** `~ model="qwen"` references the instance keyed `qwen` in the registry. The registry resolves to the configured connector implementation.
2. **Registered instance → underlying model.** Each `OllamaLocalModel` is constructed with the actual model tag (e.g. `qwen2.5:7b`). The skill never sees the tag directly.

### Example instance names

| Name | Underlying model | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `default` | `gemma2:9b` | Resolved when `model=` is omitted; alias of `gemma2` |
| `gemma2` | `gemma2:9b` | Explicit name; matches the convention below |
| `qwen` | `qwen2.5:7b` | Interactive, latency-sensitive |

`default` and `gemma2` can point at the same `OllamaLocalModel` configuration. The alias exists so skill syntax can match a tier convention ("use gemma2 for batch") rather than the back-compat name (`default`). Existing skills that wrote `model="default"` continue to work unchanged; new skills should prefer the explicit name.

### Convention: model tier by use case

- **Small classification-class model** (e.g., `gemma2`) for *batch and scan work* — atomization, large-batch classification, anything async or background-scheduled.
- **Longer-context dispatch-class model** (e.g., `qwen`) for *interactive verdicts in skills* — single-shot decisions inside an active dispatch where latency matters and queue contention with batch work would block forward progress.

When in doubt: small model if the call is asynchronous from a user/agent's perspective, larger model if a downstream op depends on the response.

### Contention property

Any skill that calls `~` shares the underlying local-model service with every other process on the deployment that dispatches to the same model. Most local-model services serialize per-model dispatch. A skill that fires asynchronous batch work via `$` (e.g. invoking a batch-classification tool that dispatches N calls to model X) and then immediately calls `~ model="X"` will race itself — the synchronous call queues behind the dispatched batch.

The runtime does not promise concurrency-safe model dispatch. Skill authors and operators own model-tier allocation. The canonical mitigation: use distinct models for the synchronous and asynchronous paths (a smaller model for interactive verdicts, a larger model for batch).

### Adopter deployments

Adopters override the bundled set via `connectors.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "localModels": {
    "default": { "type": "OllamaLocalModel", "model": "llama3.2:3b" },
    "fast":    { "type": "OllamaLocalModel", "model": "phi3:mini" }
  }
}
```

Adopters with no local models register no LocalModel instances. Skills with `~` ops fail at dispatch with `LocalModel '<name>' not registered`. Phase 5 `# Requires:` capability declarations promote this to a compile-time fail-fast — a skill that requires LocalModel won't compile if none is configured. Substrate-blind skills (no `~` ops) work unchanged.

## Per-skill connector selection

Skills declare which connector they use, by name, when they care:

```
# Connectors: memorystore=project, localmodel=qwen, mcp=[primary, personal]
```

Meaning: *"this skill requires the named connectors, or compatible alternatives declared via Phase 5 `# Requires:` capabilities."* Discipline about declared intent. A skill that depends on a project-scoped store or a personal MCP says so; a substrate-blind skill omits the header.

Runtime fails fast if a named connector is unavailable. The `mcp=[...]` header is enforcement-pending (Phase 3 of the connector-routed `$` work, deferred until 2-3 skills cite non-primary connectors and authoring discipline benefits).

## Connector resolution chain

Connectors are runtime-resolved — the compiler stays pure read+transform. Compiled artifacts are generic; any runtime can dispatch them through whatever connectors it has configured. Resolution chain for *which connectors are wired up* (first match wins):

1. **Env var** — `SKILLFILE_MEMORY_STORE`, `SKILLFILE_LOCAL_MODEL`, or `SKILLFILE_CONNECTORS_CONFIG` for multi-store. Ad-hoc / test override.
2. **Working-dir / agent-scoped `connectors.json`** — persistent per-agent override, supports multiple named connectors per type.
3. **Server default** — bundled with the compiler. Common-case fallback.

Per-deployment naming lives in config, not the contract. A given deployment registers concrete instances under whatever names make sense locally; skill authors reference those names.

## Per-call identity overrides (McpConnector)

A skill running under one identity can dispatch against a personal MCP server under a different identity without needing connector-internal state. The merge order at dispatch (top wins):

1. **Registry-configured per-connector identity** — set in `connectors.json` (`identity: { agentId: "<id>", isAdmin: false }`) at connector instantiation. Locks an identity to a connector.
2. **Per-call `ctxOverrides`** — threaded by the runtime per the security boundary contract. A skill running as agent X passes `{ agentId: "X", isAdmin: false }` into every `$` op.
3. **(no intrinsic identity)** — adapter forwards whatever the merge produces.

Configured identity is a *partial merge* — unmentioned keys (e.g., `isAdmin`) flow through from the per-call ctx. Lets a connector lock `agentId` without clobbering the runtime's admin-drop discipline. Default connectors should configure no intrinsic identity, so `ctxOverrides` always wins — preserving the runtime's authority-flow guarantees intact.

## Portable shapes

```typescript
interface PortableMemory {
  // Core fields — mandatory on every connector return.
  id: string;
  summary: string;
  detail?: string;
  score?: number;

  // Curated substrate subset — concept-portable, value-substrate-specific.
  // Top-level access via $(MEMORY.field). Connectors populate when the
  // concept applies. MUST NOT also be duplicated into metadata.
  thread_status?: string;
  pinned?: boolean;
  confidence?: number;
  domain_tags?: string[];
  payload_type?: string;
  knowledge_type?: string;
  recipients?: string[];
  expires_at?: number;
  created_at?: number;
  agent_id?: string;
  vault?: string;

  // Substrate-specific bag. Accessed via $(MEMORY.metadata.X).
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}

interface QueryFilters {
  query: string;
  limit: number;
  mode: "fts" | "semantic" | "rerank" | string;
  [key: string]: unknown;
}

interface McpDispatchCtx {
  agentId?: string;
  isAdmin?: boolean;
}
```

## Field access semantics

`$(MEMORY.field)` resolves in tiers:
1. Core fields (id, summary, detail, score)
2. Curated substrate subset (thread_status, pinned, etc.)
3. `metadata.X` for everything else
4. Ambient passthrough as literal `$(MEMORY.field)` if unresolved

**Connector duplication is a contract violation.** If a field is in the curated subset, the connector populates it at top-level only — `metadata.<same_name>` MUST be absent. Otherwise `$(M.thread_status)` and `$(M.metadata.thread_status)` can return different values (silent data divergence). Connectors enforce.

## Why connector abstraction matters

Hard-coupling skills to specific substrates would make information-flow decisions infrastructural rather than skill-authored, defeating the point of skills as the agent's programming language. The connector layer is what lets the same skill body run against substrate A today and run against substrate B tomorrow without rewriting.

## Tests — # Tests: block, given/expect assertions (pending v2)

The `# Tests:` header introduces a block of test cases that travel with the skill body. Each case has `given:` (variable overrides) and `expect:` (assertions on the compiled output or runtime side effects).

## Status: pending v2

Header parsing and test runner not yet shipped. The grammar below is the agreed design but the implementation is queued behind shipping `&` skill-invocation and runtime trigger dispatch.

## Proposed grammar

```
# Tests:
  - name: "basic_url_filter"
    given:
      LOCATION: "Asheville, NC"
    expect:
      compiled_output_contains: "wttr.in/Asheville%2C%20NC"

  - name: "missing_required_var_errors"
    given:
      LOCATION: null
    expect:
      compile_error: "Missing required variable: LOCATION"

  - name: "fetch_failure_runs_else_block"
    given:
      TOPIC: "definitely-not-a-real-topic-xyz"
    expect:
      target_else_executed: "fetch"
      result_value: ""
```

## Execution

Run via the compile API with `format: "test"` (and optional `test_case: "<name>"` to run a single case). All cases run when `test_case` is omitted. Returns pass/fail per assertion with diagnostic detail.

Normal `prompt` / `prose` compilation ignores the `# Tests:` section entirely — tests travel with the skill without affecting production use.

## Assertion types

### Compile-time assertions

- `compiled_output_contains: "<substring>"` — the rendered prompt artifact contains the given substring
- `compile_error: "<substring>"` — compilation fails with an error message containing the substring
- `compiled_output_does_not_contain: "<substring>"` — negative assertion

### Runtime assertions (for `format: "test"` execution)

- `target_else_executed: "<target_name>"` — verifies the `else:` branch ran
- `onerror_invoked: "<fallback_skill>"` — verifies the `# OnError:` skill was called
- `op_fallback_used: "<target.op_index>"` — verifies an op-level fallback value was substituted
- `result_value: "<expected_string>"` — the skill's final output value

## Open spec questions

### Runtime assertion sandboxing

`# Tests:` cases that exercise runtime behavior (memory writes, shell ops, LocalModel calls) need a sandbox so they don't pollute production data. Two approaches:
- Scratch DB / scratch connector overrides for tests
- Skip-and-warn for non-deterministic ops, only assert deterministic compile-time properties

Out of v2 scope; deferred until the test runner ships.

### Discovery and naming collisions

When the skill library grows past ~20 skills, name typos in `&` invocations become a real risk. No "list available skills with their inputs" surface yet. Probably wants a `skill_list` API and/or an IDE plugin.

### Property-based tests

The current design covers example-based tests. Property-based tests (`for all inputs in {...}, output matches pattern X`) would be a useful future addition but require a generator framework. Out of v2 scope.

## Connection to authoring discipline

The PRD's pitch — *authoring loop becomes "author → lint → revise → store"* — depends on tests-as-preflight being cheap to author and cheap to run. The `# Tests:` block makes this possible at skill-source-level; the lint pass enforces structural correctness; together they raise the bar for what enters the library.

## Future grammar extensions — sensors, time primitives, suppression, persistent state, capability declarations, debounce

This section documents language-design additions planned for future phases. These aren't yet shipped, but the design has been thought through enough that authors should know what's coming and what categories of work the language is reaching toward.

## Sensors as a language category (Phase 3)

Currently `# Triggers:` includes `sensor:` as a trigger source. The v3 redesign splits sensors into their own category:

```
# Sensors: presence, screen-state, voice-prosody
# Triggers: cron: 0 8 * * *
```

**Distinction:** Sensors are continuous channels the agent reads but doesn't emit on. Triggers are discrete events that fire the skill. Conflating them in one header produces a worse language for both — sensors need different semantics (continuous read, accessible via ambient refs, privacy-gated) than triggers (discrete fire, dispatch semantics).

Pending: ambient refs for sensor values (`$(SENSOR.presence)`, `$(SENSOR.voice-prosody.affect)`) and the privacy-gating discipline that determines when a sensor is readable.

## Time as first-class primitives (Phase 3)

Current ambient time: `$(NOW)` (wall-clock timestamp). Pending:

```
$(SECONDS_SINCE_LAST_USER_MESSAGE)
$(MINUTES_SINCE_SESSION_START)
$(SECONDS_SINCE_LAST_FIRE_OF.<skill-name>)
```

**Rationale:** Most "right time" reasoning is relative, not wall-clock. Authoring relative-time guards requires either runtime-state tracking (which authors then rebuild manually) or first-class primitives. The latter wins.

## Absence as trigger (Phase 3)

Different shape from event triggers — "fire if user hasn't messaged in N minutes" is a wait-for-nothing primitive, not a wait-for-event primitive. Proposed grammar:

```
# Triggers: idle: 5m
```

Runtime tracks the relevant idleness counter and fires when the threshold crosses. Separate dispatch mechanism from event triggers.

## Time-windowed aggregation (Phase 3)

Filter-like primitives that operate on state across firings:

```
~ prompt="..." -> VERDICT
# pseudo-syntax pending: aggregate over a window
$(VERDICT|last-5|count-where:value=="frustrated")
```

**Rationale:** "User has shown frustration in 3 of 5 recent turns" is a canonical sensor-derived condition. Without first-class windowing, every skill rebuilds ring buffers. Pending design: filter syntax vs new op kind.

## Backpressure / debouncing (Phase 3)

Sensors produce floods. First-class primitives for rate limiting:

```
# Debounce: 5s
# RateLimit: 1/minute
# Coalesce: latest
```

Headers declare the runtime's queueing policy. Runtime enforces; skill body doesn't reimplement.

## Suppression as valid output (Phase 1, pending)

Current behavior: a skill that fires must produce *some* output (even empty string). Pending: explicit "fire-and-suppress" — the skill considered the situation and decided not to emit. Different from `# Output: none` (which signals "I do side effects only").

Proposed: `! suppress` or `$set OUTPUT = null` triggers suppression-detection in the runtime. Output routers skip delivery; trigger fire counts increment for telemetry; no consumer surface receives noise.

**Rationale:** Without suppression, signal pipelines become noisy. "Fire everything, hope the right one wins" turns the inbox-to-context into spam. Discipline that makes pub-sub tractable.

## Persistent state with declared scope (Phase 1, pending)

Current `$set` is per-execution; no lifecycle beyond the fire. Pending:

```
$set NAME = value scope=skill-local
$set NAME = value scope=agent-global
$set NAME = value scope=session
```

**Scopes:**
- `skill-local` — persists across fires of this skill, not visible to other skills
- `agent-global` — visible to all skills of the same agent
- `session` — alive for the duration of the current session, cleared at session end

Backed by a configured data-records connector (the same surface `# Requires:` reads from) with conventionally-namespaced keys (e.g., `state:skill-local:<skill-name>:<key>`).

**Rationale:** Most interesting skills need memory across firings — change-detection, windowing, dedup-against-recent. Without lifecycle, every skill rebuilds state tracking via raw memory-write / memory-query calls.

## Cross-skill pub-sub (Phase 4)

Procedural `&` invocation handles one-to-one composition. Pub-sub handles many-to-many.

```
# Publishes: signal.frustration-detected
# Subscribes: signal.user-confused
```

When a skill publishes a signal, all subscribed skills fire (independent executions, parallel dispatch). Decouples emitters from consumers — the inverse of `&`'s direct invocation.

**Rationale:** When signal flow is many-to-many, `&` couples everything to everything. Pub-sub keeps emitters ignorant of consumers.

## Confidence/threshold gating (Phase 4)

Declarative guards on skill firing:

```
# RequiresConfidence: classifier >= 0.8
# RequiresThreshold: change-delta >= 0.3
```

Runtime evaluates the guard before dispatching the skill body. Lets sensitive skills opt out of low-confidence triggers without each skill's body rebuilding the same guard expression.

## Invocation-control axis (Phase 4)

Currently a skill is uniformly invocable from any caller (user via explicit command, agent mid-conversation, trigger autonomous fire). Some skills are user-only intents (user types a slash-command to invoke), some are agent-only behaviors (agent picks the skill via description-match while reasoning), some are trigger-only autonomous fires.

Proposed grammar:

```
# Invocable-By: user, agent, trigger
# Invocable-By: trigger            # autonomous only
# Invocable-By: user               # explicit-command only; agent can't pick it via reasoning
```

Header is a permissive list; absent means all three (current default behavior). Lint flags semantically-inconsistent declarations — a skill with `# Triggers: cron:` but `# Invocable-By: user` is a contradiction the rule catches.

**Rationale:** without the axis, sensitive operations (destructive writes, external messages, irreversible state changes) leak across invocation boundaries. An agent reading skill descriptions might invoke a skill that should only fire on explicit user command. Phase 5 capability declarations enforce more granularly, but the user/agent/trigger triad is the structural distinction that catches most surface-leak bugs cheaply.

## Channel/locality awareness (Phase 4)

Ambient refs for current channel state:

```
$(CHANNEL_TYPE)       # slack-dm, slack-channel, voice, web, etc.
$(CHANNEL_PRIVACY)    # private, public, group
$(CHANNEL_NAME)
```

Privacy gating uses these. A sensor-fired skill that reads `voice-prosody` should not emit to a public channel. Runtime enforces; ambient refs let skill bodies make routing decisions.

**This is the structural gate** that makes the sensor direction socially defensible — privacy as precondition, not feature.

## Introspection primitives (Phase 5)

Self-state queries:

```
$(PROMPT_CONTEXT.size)
$(SKILLS_FIRED_RECENTLY.last-1h)
$(SELF.confidence-trend)
```

**Rationale:** Skills can't reason about other skills' state today. Introspection closes the gap.

## Capability declarations (Phase 5)

Skill declares its required surfaces:

```
# Requires-Capabilities: sensors=[mic, camera], tools=[memorystore.write, slack.post]
# Requires-Privacy: private-channel-only
```

Runtime fails-fast on missing capabilities. Trust precondition for sensor work — operators can audit which skills touch which surfaces.

## Build order rationale

Phases must land in order:
- Phase 0 → 1 → 2 are foundation; without them, sensor work compounds problems
- Phase 3 (sensors) needs Phase 1 (suppression, state) and Phase 2 (core ops, session triggers) solid first
- Phase 4 (routing) has nothing to route until sensors produce traffic
- Phase 5 (introspection) is ergonomic, not foundational — useful but skippable

## When the language extends, this section moves

When any of these primitives ship, the relevant grammar moves into its canonical section (Ops reference, Variables, Triggers, etc.) and this section's entry is replaced with a cross-reference. Future-extensions section stays alive for the next horizon of unshipped work — it's a continuous staging area, not a once-and-done document.

## Open spec questions — unresolved language design decisions

Questions surfaced during design that haven't been resolved. Each carries a current lean where applicable; spec must commit at implementation time. Items marked **[RESOLVED 2026-05-21]** are locked decisions awaiting (or already in) implementation.

## 1. `?` op explicit prompt — confirm v3 requirement — **[RESOLVED 2026-05-21]**

The bare `?` form is the most fragile primitive in the language. Implicit-context-reading drifts subtly across model versions. **Resolution:** `?` deprecated. Compile-warn in v1 (every bare `?` warns with rewrite suggestion `~ prompt="..." -> VAR`); compile-error in v1.x. Hardening before v2 because the population producing the debt is mostly agents, which compounds — an agent will author hundreds of skills referencing `?` during the same wall-clock window a human team would author ten. Diagnostic includes the explicit rewrite shape per Section 2 Ops.

## 2. `??` decline semantics — **[RESOLVED 2026-05-21]**

When the user responds "no"/"n"/falsey to a `??` prompt in interactive mode, what happens to dependent targets? **Resolution:** bind the response to the output variable AND short-circuit downstream targets (treat as soft op-error so `else:` fires). Silent fall-through to subsequent `apply:` is exactly the security bug pattern; bind-AND-short-circuit closes it cleanly. Per Section 2 Ops `??` documentation.

## 3. Block execution model — write down the rules

Within a target body, op ordering and variable binding conventions aren't fully written down. Specific questions:
- Can `!` directives precede `$` ops in the same target? (Yes; `!` has no dependency on subsequent ops.)
- What's the default output binding when `-> NAME` is omitted? (`$(target.output)` — same as bare `target` referenced from other blocks.)
- How do cross-block references work syntactically? (`$(other_target.output)` or `$(VAR_BOUND_THERE)`.)

**Write a "Block execution model" subsection.** No semantic change, just documentation gap.

## 4. `$` op prose suffix — disallow in v3

Example: `$ Edit file_path=... — merge hooks.PreToolUse block from $(plan.output)`. The em-dash + prose only works in agent-mediated execution because the agent interprets prose. Runtime-mediated execution ignores or errors on the trailing prose.

Lean: disallow prose in `$` for standalone v3. Args only, structured. Prose moves to a `~` op (LocalModel) that produces structured instructions; `$` consumes them. Keeps `$` semantics deterministic across both execution paths. **Resolve in language reference revision.**

## 5. `default:` semantics — make goal-directed shape explicit

`default:` names the *goal target*, not the entry point. The runtime walks dependencies backward through topo-sort. Skills with one target obscure this; multi-target skills make it visible. Authors writing imperative-style ("do A, then B") will be surprised by execution order otherwise.

**Status:** Already covered in the Overview section. Surface again in operator-of-skills tutorial material.

## 6. `&` skill-invocation output binding

What does `$(WEATHER)` contain after `& get-weather -> WEATHER`? Probable answer: the called skill's `default:` target output. Should be made explicit when `&` ships. Affects compiler; affects how authors reason about composed output.

## 7. `else:` block visibility into the error

Should `$(ERROR)` be an ambient ref inside `else:` blocks, populated with the error type/message? Lean: yes, same shape as `$(ERROR_CONTEXT)` in `# OnError:`. Useful for logging/telemetry skills. **Not yet shipped.**

## 8. Nested `# OnError:`

If `# OnError: degraded-skill` fires and `degraded-skill` itself errors, what happens? Lean: hard exit, no nested fallbacks. **Spec committed; documented in Error handling section.**

## 9. Multiple triggers — concurrency

If `cron: 0 8 * * *` and `event: user.present` both fire within seconds, does the skill run twice (independent) or get deduped? Lean: independent. Author dedups via state if needed. Affects dispatch layer.

## 10. `&` invocation vs trigger firing

When skill A invokes skill B via `&`, do skill B's `# Triggers:` fire? Almost certainly no — `&` is direct invocation, distinct from the trigger event surface. **Worth saying explicitly when `&` ships.**

## 11. File-watch path semantics

Recursive or directory-only by default? Inotify supports both. Lean: directory-only default; offer recursive via `file-watch-recursive:` or `file-watch: <path> (recursive)`. Affects dispatch layer.

## 12. Output target delivery failures

If `# Output: slack: <channel>` and Slack is down, what happens? Lean: delivery failure is its own retryable error; queue if possible, else error to caller. Worth a separate small spec section. Affects dispatch layer.

## 13. Compile-time vs runtime fallback evaluation timing

`# Requires:` fallbacks are compile-time. Op-level `(fallback: ...)` and `else:` blocks are runtime. Authoring clarification needed. **One-table summary in the spec would close the gap.**

## 14. Skill versioning rollback UX

Edits via upsert preserve history through substrate versioning, but no first-class "rollback" affordance. Probably needs a `--version <N>` flag on the compile API or a sister tool. **Out of v2 scope; track as future work.**

## 15. Skill discoverability

When the library grows past ~20 skills, name typos in `&` invocations become a real risk. No "list available skills with their inputs" surface yet. **Out of v2 scope; track as future work.**

## 16. `?` op explicit prompt — migration path — **[RESOLVED 2026-05-21]**

Pairs with #1. When the language deprecates bare `?`, existing skills in the library need to be migrated. **Resolution:** the v1 compile-warn diagnostic carries the explicit rewrite (`~ prompt="..." -> VAR`); a lint pass surfaces bare-`?` usage with the same rewrite for batch authoring assistance. No automated rewrite tool in v1 — the diagnostic is sufficient given that agents (not humans) are the primary authoring population, and agent reads of the diagnostic trigger the rewrite naturally.

## 17. Connector capability declarations

Skills can declare required connector capabilities via `# Requires:` (Phase 5). Examples: "needs semantic search," "needs structured-extraction model with 32K context." Useful for the substrate-portable story. **Pending design.**

## 18. Per-op timeouts

Hung dispatches hang the skill without explicit timeout configuration. Lean: skill-level `# Timeout:` header + per-op `timeoutSeconds=N` kwarg + runtime defaults. **Pending implementation in T5; ERD §6 specifies the four-level resolution chain.**

## 19. Data-skill primitive — which op fetches a data skill?

If we adopt the procedural-skills vs data-skills distinction (the compiler produces separate artifact types, the procedural skill is unchanged when data updates), an open question remains: which op references a data skill from a procedural one? Four viable shapes:

- **Extend `# Requires:` to data skills.** Keeps data lookup compile-time, baking the data value into the compiled artifact. Loses runtime flexibility but gains determinism + reproducibility.
- **Use `>` retrieval.** Data skills are a tagged record class returned by `>` queries. Composes with existing primitives; data is runtime-fetched.
- **Dedicated data-fetch op** (e.g., `^ skill_name -> VAR`). Explicitly different from procedure-call `&`; signals intent at read time. Adds one more op kind to the grammar.
- **Same `&` op, compiler inlines at compile time.** Uniform syntax with procedure invocation, but compiler treats data-skill references as compile-time includes. Author syntax is the same; semantics diverge based on the referenced artifact's type.

Lean: option 4 (uniform `&` with compile-time inline for data skills). Best of both — uniform call surface for authors, deterministic compile-time semantics for data, runtime-execution semantics for procedural. Compiler tracks "compiled against version N of data skill X" for staleness tracking; data update triggers recompile of dependent procedural skills.

Operational implication differs by choice: compile-time inline means data update → recompile dependent skills → new compiled artifacts published (more rebuild churn but deterministic at runtime). Runtime fetch means data update is invisible to the procedural skill until next invocation (less churn but less predictable).

**Resolve before data-skill payload type ships.** Affects compiler, lint pass, and the `# Requires:` cascade design.

## 20. Syntax footgun audit — **[RESOLVED 2026-05-21]**

A six-item syntax-footgun audit was conducted pre-T5 to lock disambiguation policies before the runtime locked more behavior into stone:

- **Indentation discipline** — spaces-only. Mixed tabs+spaces parse error. Per Section 1 Lexical conventions.
- **Reserved keywords** — `default`, `needs`, `if`, `elif`, `else`, `foreach`, `in`, `not`, `unsafe` (current). `while`, `for`, `match`, `try`, `catch`, `return` (future-reserved for v2 forward compatibility). Reserved-name use is a parse error with helpful diagnostic. Case-sensitive exact match. Per Section 1.
- **`# Status:` and other enumerated value spaces** — case-insensitive on input, stored as canonical form. Per Section 1 + Section 8.
- **`=` vs `==` in conditions** — single-`=` in `if`/`elif` is a parse error with specific diagnostic. Per Section 5.
- **`$(VAR)` vs `$$(bash-command)` inside `@ unsafe`** — `$$` escape signals bash command-substitution; bare `$()` is skillscript variable. Lint rule `unsafe-shell-ambiguous-subst` fires when `$()` in `@ unsafe` doesn't resolve to a declared var; diagnostic offers both rewrites. Per Section 2 Ops `@ unsafe` subsection.
- **Bracket-aware comma splitting** — parser respects bracket depth in `# Vars:` value parsing. Per Section 3.

All six are locked. T5 implements parser + lint + dispatcher per these dispositions.
