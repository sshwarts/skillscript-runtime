# Changelog

## 0.2.6 — 2026-05-22

**Language polish — Items 2 + 3 from the v0.2.5 kickoff** (Perry's thread
`f75477a4`). AgentConnector DeliveryPayload now carries full provenance
+ augmenting-context fields; two new frontmatter headers populate them.
Plus a doc + example response to Perry's Signal 1 (`|length` under-
discoverable).

### Added
- **`source_skill?: string` on the `augment` variant** of
  `DeliveryPayload` (was template-only in T7.1). Receiving agents reading
  an augment now know which skill authored it for correlation /
  auditability.
- **`triggered_by?: TriggerProvenance` on both variants.** Threads
  `{source, name, fired_at_ms}` through every delivery so receivers can
  disambiguate cron / session / manual / event fires. Populated from
  `ExecuteContext.triggerCtx` — scheduler-fired skills carry full
  provenance, ad-hoc `execute()` callers without a trigger ctx omit it.
- **`# Delivery-context: <prose>` header.** Routed to the receiving
  agent alongside the augment payload as `delivery_context` so the agent
  knows *why* it's being notified.
- **`# Templates: <name>, <name>, ...` header.** Comma-separated list of
  Template-skill names the receiving agent may fetch as follow-on
  actions. Routed as `templates: string[]`.
- **Tier-2 lint rule `unused-augmenting-header`.** Fires when
  `# Delivery-context:` or `# Templates:` appears on a Headless skill
  (no `prompt-context:` or `template:` output declaration) — those
  fields would never reach a substrate.
- **`examples/queue-length-monitor.skill.md`** — canonical
  "count items via `|length`, compare to threshold" pattern. Closes
  Perry's Signal 1: cold authors weren't reaching for `|length`
  naturally; examples beat spec for discoverability.

### Fixed
- **Stale `(v2)` markers in the language reference's ambient refs table.**
  `TRIGGER_TYPE`, `TRIGGER_PAYLOAD`, `EVENT.*` are all shipped and
  auto-injected at runtime; the "(v2)" suffix incorrectly implied
  "not yet available." Removed; descriptions sharpened to name the
  concrete values.

### Internal
- Added a `RecordingAgentConnector` test fixture in `tests/v0.2.6.test.ts`
  to verify payload threading end-to-end through the runtime dispatch.
- 600/600 tests passing (588 + 12 new fixtures). Narrow-core LOC
  unchanged at 4880/13.

### Validation
Perry's v0.2.5 Item-1 validation pass returned 6/6 regression + 3/3
fresh-minion compile clean. Surfaced Signal 1 (length discoverability —
addressed by the new example) and Signal 2 (lint gap on `$(NOW)` —
verified non-issue; the misread inspired the ambient-table doc fix).

### Acknowledgments
Perry — kickoff scope and validation cadence remains the same one-hour
loop that surfaced bugs A-F across v0.2.2-v0.2.4.

## 0.2.5 — 2026-05-22

**Language polish — Item 1 of 5 from v0.2.5 kickoff** (Perry's thread
`f75477a4`). The "orchestration carve-out" addition: comparison is
orchestration, arithmetic is tool computation. This patch ships the
comparison + counting affordances; items 2-5 follow after Perry's
validation pass.

### Added
- **Comparison operators `<` / `>` / `<=` / `>=`** in `if` / `elif`
  conditions. Both ref-vs-literal (`$(N) > "10"`) and ref-vs-ref
  (`$(A) <= $(B)`) shapes; filters + dotted field access permitted on
  either side, matching the existing `==`/`!=` surface.
- **Numeric coercion at runtime.** Both operands pass through `Number()`;
  non-finite results throw `TypeMismatchError` with structured operands
  + ref description + canned remediation. Silent lexicographic fallback
  (which would mis-compare `"9" < "10"` as false) is explicitly rejected.
- **`|length` filter.** Returns element count when the value JSON-parses
  as an array; returns character count otherwise. Pairs with the new
  comparisons for skills like `if $(ITEMS|length) > "0":`.
- **`TypeMismatchError` class** extending `OpError`. Surfaced via
  `result.errors[]` with `operator`, `lhs`, `rhs`, `refDesc` fields plus
  remediation suggesting `|trim` / `|length` / model-output preprocessing.

### Scope
**In:** comparison operators, `|length` filter, the type-error class.
**Out:** arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), aggregates (`min`, `max`,
`sum`, `mean`). Those stay in tools. The line: *comparison is
orchestration; arithmetic is computation.*

### Test coverage
29 new fixtures in `tests/v0.2.5.test.ts` covering: parser grammar
acceptance, ref-vs-literal evaluation, ref-vs-ref evaluation, numeric-
vs-lexicographic regression guard, `TypeMismatchError` shape, `|length`
on arrays + strings + JSON objects, end-to-end compile of the canonical
threshold + queue-watch skill shapes. 588/588 total green.

### Acknowledgments
Perry — for the orchestration carve-out framing and the kickoff scope.

## 0.2.4 — 2026-05-22

**Two more parser bugs from Perry's 6-minion battery via `compile_skill`.**
v0.2.3's authoring tools gave Perry the cleanest possible validation
surface — 30 seconds later, she had two new bugs filed (thread `e609a448`).
Both parser-only, both shipped.

### Fixed
- **Bug D (regression from v0.2.2): apostrophe in plain text swallows targets.**
  The v0.2.2 `foldQuotedContinuations` pre-pass tracked single-quotes
  globally — an apostrophe in `# Description: symbol's intraday drops`
  opened an unclosed-string scope that absorbed all subsequent lines,
  leaving zero targets visible and producing a `[no-targets]` lint error.
  Hit by 2/6 cold authors. Fix: limit fold engagement to kwarg-bearing
  op lines (`~ `, `> `, `& `) — the three op kinds where values
  legitimately span newlines. Frontmatter, `!` literals, `@` shell
  bodies, and target labels are now left untouched.
- **Bug F (pre-existing): `(fallback: ...)` after `-> VAR` broke binding
  on `@` and `&` ops.** `$`/`~`/`>` had explicit fallback support in
  their regexes; `@` (parser.ts:1049) and `&` (`AMPERSAND_OP_REGEX`)
  didn't. The trailing `(fallback: ...)` clause prevented the `-> VAR`
  extractor from matching → outputVar never bound → downstream
  `$(VAR)` fired `undeclared-var` diagnostics on variables that
  authors had clearly declared. Hit by 2/6 cold authors. Fix: extend
  both regexes with `(?:\s+\(fallback\s*:\s*(.+?)\))?` and thread
  the captured fallback into the op record. `@ unsafe` variant also
  fixed for parity.

### Validation
Perry's 6-minion compile matrix:

| State | v0.2.3 | v0.2.4 (projected) |
|---|---|---|
| Pass | 3/6 | 6/6 |

(v0.2.4 projection — three minions previously failed on D and/or F;
sed-removing the apostrophe and rewriting the fallback clause cleared
both per Perry's testing. Test fixtures in `tests/v0.2.4.test.ts`
cover both bug repros and regression guards.)

### Acknowledgments
Perry — for the back-to-back minion-battery runs that surface bugs in
single-hour cadence after each ship.

## 0.2.3 — 2026-05-22

**Over-the-wire authoring lifecycle.** v0.2.0–v0.2.2 gave foreign MCP clients
a way to *observe* and *manage* running skills but not to *author* them
— pushing a new skill required filesystem access to the SkillStore root.
v0.2.3 closes that gap with three new MCP tools per Perry's design
(thread `f48b8ef3`).

### Added
- **`lint_skill({source?|name})` — 9th MCP tool.** Read-only. Returns
  diagnostics across tier 1/2/3, plus `passes_tier_1/2/3` booleans for
  cheap pass/fail checks. Accepts a literal source body (inner-loop
  iteration) or a stored skill name (re-validation).
- **`compile_skill({source?|name, inputs?})` — 10th MCP tool.** Read-only.
  Returns the rendered artifact + `target_order` + `resolved_variables`
  + warnings + errors. Compile failures land in the `errors` array
  rather than throwing, so cold authors get a diagnostic surface to
  iterate against instead of opaque tool failures.
- **`skill_write({name, source, overwrite?})` — 11th MCP tool, write.**
  Tier-1 lint runs at write time (SkillStore contract). Returns version
  + content_hash. Always lands as `Draft` — promote to `Approved` via
  the existing `skill_status` tool to enforce explicit-approval discipline.
  `overwrite` defaults to `false`; existing skills with the same name
  reject the write.

### Workflow
The cold-author flow over MCP becomes:
1. `lint_skill({source})` — fast feedback while drafting
2. `compile_skill({source, inputs})` — confirm the artifact looks right
3. `skill_write({name, source})` — commit to SkillStore as Draft
4. `skill_status({name, new_state: "Approved"})` — explicit deploy
5. `register_trigger({skill_name, source: "cron", name: "...")` — fire
6. `health_metrics({skills: [name]})` — observe fires

Six tools, one round-trip each, no filesystem dependency. The integration
test in `tests/v0.2.3.test.ts` exercises the full lifecycle end-to-end.

### Acknowledgments
Thanks to Perry for the three-tool bundle design (thread `f48b8ef3`),
turned around within an hour of the v0.2.2 ship.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-05-22

**Parser fixes from cold-author minion battery.** Perry ran 3 independent
cold-agent SDK authors against the stock-monitor exercise; they converged
on three parser failure modes. All three fixed in this patch — pure parser
changes, no runtime or dispatcher impact.

### Fixed
- **Bug A: `# Triggers:` comma-split breaks cron expressions with commas.**
  Hit by 3/3 cold authors. Cron syntax naturally has commas
  (`30,45 9 * * 1-5` = run at 9:30 and 9:45 on weekdays). The trigger header
  parser split on bare commas, mistakenly treating the cron-internal comma
  as a multi-trigger delimiter. Now splits at source-keyword boundaries
  (cron/session/event/agent-event/file-watch/sensor) instead — single-cron-
  with-commas parses as one trigger; multiple triggers still split correctly.
- **Bug B: Multi-line `~ prompt="..."` strings break the parser.** Hit by
  2/3 cold authors. The line-iterating parse loop treated interior newlines
  inside quoted kwarg values as block separators. Now a quote-aware pre-pass
  folds unclosed-quote continuations into a single logical line, and the op
  regexes (`~`, `>`, `&`) carry the `s` flag so `.` matches across newlines.
  Multi-paragraph LLM prompts now parse cleanly.

### Documented
- **`needs:` keyword forms.** Bug C audit confirmed the parser already
  supports all three syntactic forms (Make-style `target: dep1 dep2`,
  header form `target: needs: a, b, c`, body-line form `needs: dep`). The
  language reference now has a concrete `### Declaring target dependencies`
  example showing all three. v0.2.2 tests document supported syntax so
  future regressions surface.

### Acknowledgments
Thanks to Perry for the 3-minion cold-author battery (thread `a91db2e2`)
that surfaced these bugs in roughly an hour after v0.2.1 shipped.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-05-22

**Imperative-trigger surface fix.** v0.2.0 shipped with `register_trigger`
(via MCP) storing trigger registrations correctly but the scheduler's tick
loop was never armed inside `skillfile dashboard` — so no cron triggers
actually fired. Declarative `# Triggers:` headers had the same dormant
fate. v0.2.1 is the patch that makes the trigger surface load-bearing.
**Upgrade strongly recommended for anyone exercising the trigger APIs.**

### Fixed
- **Scheduler is now started in the dashboard host.** `cmdDashboard` calls
  `scheduler.start()` after wiring the registry, arming the 30s tick loop
  and the SIGINT/SIGTERM session-end hook.
- **Declarative `# Triggers:` headers register at boot.** The dashboard now
  walks the SkillStore at startup, parses each Approved skill, and registers
  every declared `# Triggers:` entry into the scheduler.

### Added
- **`runtime_capabilities` MCP tool** (8th built-in). Read-only discovery
  surface for cold agents — returns the wired connectors per kind
  (`skillStores`, `memoryStores`, `localModels`, `mcpConnectors`,
  `agentConnectors`), plus `shellExecution.mode` (structural-spawn vs
  bash-via-unsafe) and the runtime version. Optional per-category `include`
  filter.
- **`bootstrap()` + `defaultRegistry()` helpers** (`src/bootstrap.ts`).
  Extract the long-lived runtime host wiring — connector registry, scheduler,
  McpServer — into a single shared function so the v0.3 `serve`/`dashboard`
  split becomes a trivial new entry point rather than a refactor.
- **`Registry.list*()` enumeration methods.** `listSkillStores`,
  `listMemoryStores`, `listLocalModels`, `listMcpConnectors`,
  `listAgentConnectors` each return `Array<{ name, instance, ctor }>` for
  `runtime_capabilities` and future introspection use.

### Removed
- **`skillfile register-trigger` / `unregister-trigger` / `list-triggers`
  CLI commands.** These one-shot invocations each constructed a fresh
  in-memory Scheduler that died on process exit, making them no-ops in
  practice. The MCP tools (`register_trigger` / `unregister_trigger` /
  `list_triggers` against a live `skillfile dashboard`) are the canonical
  registration surface.

### Internal
- **CLI command surface tightened from 16 → 13 commands.** Help, dogfood
  fixture, and README updated.
- **`cmdRun`'s `buildRegistry()` collapsed to `defaultRegistry()`** —
  eliminates the duplicate registration logic between the one-shot run
  path and the long-lived dashboard host.
- **Dashboard now records traces by default** (`trace: { mode: "on" }`)
  so `fires` / `health_metrics` reflect the new tick-driven fires.

### Acknowledgments
Thanks to Perry for the cold-client MCP probe that surfaced the
imperative-trigger bug (thread `52f3d3d9-9212-49a9-b180-ae28fd1a7666`),
the structural-coupling diagnosis, and the `runtime_capabilities` design.
